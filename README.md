# github-notes
i. Git: This is the **actual** version control software application which was invented by the creator of Linux.

ii. Github: This is just a web site for you to sign up and have an account, but this can do all things Git-related on a server. In other words, this is a social network for Git-managed projects.

iii. Repo: This is short for repository which is a project that can have multiple files. It's kind of like what I'm doing right now, while typing this.

iv. Commit: It's another word for "save". If you're making a file and you see a button that says "Commit changes...", that means if you click on it, it will save this file. But there are two options:
1. Commit directly to the `main` branch
2. Create a new branch for this commit

I'm going to commit this change directly to the `main` branch.
